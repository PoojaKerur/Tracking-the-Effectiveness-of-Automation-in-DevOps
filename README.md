# Tracking-the-Effectiveness-of-Automation-in-DevOps

## Project Overview  
This project evaluates the impact of **automation in DevOps** by analyzing key metrics related to **CI/CD pipelines, build performance, deployment efficiency, and error tracking**. The data is visualized using **Power BI** to gain insights into automation effectiveness.

## Dataset Information  
The dataset consists of logs from **Jenkins, Docker, and other DevOps tools**, tracking automation performance. It includes the following key attributes:

- **Build ID** – Unique identifier for each build  
- **Triggered By** – Source of build execution (Manual, GitHub Push, Scheduler)  
- **Build Status** – Success or Failure  
- **Deployment Time (in minutes)** – Time taken for deployment  
- **Errors & Warnings** – Number of errors/warnings per build  
- **Automation Success Rate** – Percentage of successful automated tasks  

## Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization  
- **Jenkins** – CI/CD pipeline automation  
- **Docker** – Containerization  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data preprocessing  
- **SQL** – Data storage and querying  

## Visualizations in Power BI  
1. **Bar Chart** – Build Success vs. Failure Rate  
2. **Stacked Area Chart** – Error & Warning Trends Over Time  
3. **Gauge Chart** – Deployment Time Efficiency  
4. **Pie Chart** – Distribution of Automation Triggers  
5. **Heatmap** – Frequency of Errors by Date  

## How to Use This Project  
1. **Download the dataset** (CSV file).  
2. **Import data into Power BI** and clean it if required.  
3. **Create visualizations** based on the provided metrics.  
4. **Analyze trends** to evaluate DevOps efficiency.  

## Expected Outcomes  
- Enhanced **CI/CD efficiency**  
- Reduced **manual intervention in deployments**  
- Improved **decision-making for DevOps teams**  

## Future Enhancements  
- **Integration with live Jenkins/Docker logs**  
- **Automated alert system for failed builds**  
- **Predictive analytics for issue prevention**
